        What I want to say about Marx, in conclusion, in relation to the modern
        world, a hundred years later, is not to claim for him profound insight
        into what happened in a hundred and fifty years, it’s not to claim that
        he was always right, it’s not to claim that his predictions were
        perfect. It is to claim that I know of no where else to start the
        analysis of modern contemporary reality. It is to claim the centrality
        of Marx’s agenda, his questions. It is to claim the importance of his
        inspiration. It is to claim the absolutely vital importance of that
        relationship between analysis and practice – between bringing an
        understanding of the world to bear on the practice of making it
        different. It is, above all, to salute Marx’s critical and revolutionary
        spirit. One of the things Marx would never do was to take the given –
        the common sense – for granted. It was only one thing to do with what
        everybody agreed, and that is to disagree with it. To question it – to
        open it up – to take a scalpel to it. That meant long, hard hours at the
        British Museum – I don’t know how many of you know how hard those seats
        are – long, difficult hours to prize the box of capitalism open.

        But what Marx said to us was not “come here, my children, and believe in
        me.” He said “use my tools and do some work!” He said, “the word is
        there to be understood and transformed! I didn’t get very far by 1883,
        and you ain’t come so far by 1993, but let us DO SOMETHING with the
        tools we have.” Marx offered us the INSTRUMENTS for beginning to analyze
        historical reality. What more does want him to do, rise in a puff of
        smoke? He’s performed his historical task – he’s put ideas in our heads!
        He’s made us reject some of his own ideas! He’s brought us into
        confrontation with him – we’re arguing with him all the time, in order
        to figure out how the world works. That is the challenge of a very
        profound thinker. It is also, since what he was talking about was
        capitalism and socialism, the challenge of a very profound revolutionary
        socialist. That is his legacy to us today.

        Ask not for the security of science, but for the openness of a
        revolutionary practice which is informed by his ideas among others.
        Lonely scholars can’t take that up. But socialist movements can.
