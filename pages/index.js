      This is an experiment in collaborative editing, resource sharing, and
      creating.

      This site is scaffolded as a{" "}
      <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
        Next.js
      </a>{" "}
      site, which is a popular way to write modern web apps. It's built over
      React, which integrates HTML and JavaScript in a syntax known as JSX. Feel
      free to add JSX to <code>pages/index.js</code> to have it show up here --
      intros, bios, and so on. If you aren't comfortable with writing
      JavaScript/JSX, you can add a raw HTML file in <code>public/</code>; see
      the <code>example.html</code> file listed there. To preview any changes
      you make, you can run <code>pnpm install</code> and then{" "}
      <code>pnpm dev</code> and a local server will spin up to show you your
      changes. And feel free of course to talk to Nathan to have any changes or
      features put in.
